# Mushroom Dotfiles
## About:
These are the configuration files for a mushroom-themed Arch Linux setup utilizing [i3wm](https://i3wm.org "i3 Window Manager Website"). Some of it is original, but much of it is ~~shamelessly stolen from~~ inspired by other peoples' hard work. I'd like to specifically thank [zaid hassan](https://github.com/zaid-hassan/), [thompsonseanr](https://github.com/thompsonseanr/) and [morhetz](https://github.com/morhetz/).

The color scheme is taken from [morhetz/gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox "Gruvbox repo"). The [wallpaper](mush-wallpaper.jpg "Wallpaper used in this theme") is courtesy of [xGhostx](https://wall.alphacoders.com/profile.php?id=54003).
